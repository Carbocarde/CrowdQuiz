# CrowdQuiz

This website is live at: https://crowd-quiz.herokuapp.com/

The project is currently abandoned, but that doesn't mean I haven't learned a lot!

New Tech: (for me!)
- [X] Flask (Python server development in general too!)
   - [X] Blueprint Project Structure
- [X] SQLAlchemy
- [X] Bootstrap
- [X] Basic API concepts (Saving questions without reloading page)
- [X] Vanilla JS and JQuery (Saving/Adding questions to a set)


Notes:
- This was an amazing resource: https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world
- This project was last worked on on March 10th, 2021. I've learned a ton since then!
